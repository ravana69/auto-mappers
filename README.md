Four teams of intrepid explorers take on challenging environments and try to map out any space!   They're really dumb, with no knowledge of the map other than recognizing walls and whether a spot has been previously visited.  Each team has it's own personality via three randomized parameters (how `exploratory`, how `random`, and how `careful`), which will then be optimized during runtime by keeping the best 2 teams and randomizing the worst two.
